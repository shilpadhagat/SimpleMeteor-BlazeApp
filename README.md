Simple Meteor App using Blaze
======
Meteor is a full stack JavaScript (JS) framework, made up of a collection of libraries and packages, bound together.
It allows writing both client and server parts of an application in JavaScript. 

Quick Start
=======
Now install the dependencies and start running the server

```bash
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
$ git clone https://github.com/shilpadhagat/meteorBlazeApp
$ cd meteorBlazeApp
$ meteor
```

If everything goes well you should see this

```bash
> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
```

Now your app is running at [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000)
